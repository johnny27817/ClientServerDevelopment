1. **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the dashboard in Project Two. What are the advantages to working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**


2. **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approach the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this problem differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or stragies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**


3. **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**
